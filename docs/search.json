I am a member and PI of the CRC TRR 190 Rationality and Competition (project A05, together with Daniel Klapper (HU) and Martin Spann (LMU)).\nMy research focuses on consumer choice behavior at the intersection of marketing, economics, and applied econometrics, using empirical approaches to provide valuable insights for marketing researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. My work aims to deepen the understanding of individual consumer decision-making, particularly where it diverges from neoclassical economic assumptions.\nI specialize in developing and applying discrete choice models, utilizing both classical and Bayesian methods to analyze market and experimental data.\n\nNews\n\n2025-12-21: New version of my working paper: Experimental Evidence on Structural State Dependence in Demand\n2025-11-24: Talk at the University of Würzburg: Experimental Evidence on Structural State Dependence in Demand\n2025-11-01: Started as a tenured Professor of Consumer Behavior at Humboldt University of Berlin -2025-10-29: New working paper: Anchoring Methods for MaxDiff and Their Predictive Validity in Product Choice\nJoshua Benjamin Schramm, Marcel Lichters, & Daniel Guhl (2025)\n\n2025-09-29: Talk at CRC 190 Retreat in Ohlstadt: Create or Curate: The Impact of Content Portfolio Characteristics on Driving Subscriptions"
